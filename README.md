# About the code:
The code in this project generates a Neutral Hald file in `png` format (and different sample size) containing the Lut representation of all the colors.

Also, provides a way to generate a `cube` file from a transformed Hald png file, that can be used in Premiere (or any other video edit software) to apply the transformation of colors. 


### Language: 
- **Hald**: The visual representation of a Lut in 3D.
- **Lut**: Look up table. A "table" containing the transformation between colors (from original to final color)
- **Sample size**: Number of representations of the colors inside the matrix.
